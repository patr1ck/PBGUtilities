// PBGJsonInterface is designed to let you communicate with JSON endpoints very quickly and easily. 
// It's not designed to be full featured, client-side connection manager. It just lets you GET and POST things
// with an easy, block-based call. Note that the block you pass will be called on the main thread.

// If you build this with PBGJSONCONNECTIONLOGGING definited, you can get more logging detail.

// This class requires iOS 5.0 or greater.
